NAME
    hzip.st - file compression and decompression utility
SYNOPSIS
    hzip.st -dtcu inputfile [outputfile]
DESCRIPTION
        A file is either compressed (with the -c option),
    uncompressed (with the -u option), one of which is required,
    unless the -t option is specified. The input filename is required.
    If the output filename is not specified, output is written
    to the standard output.
OPTIONS
        All options must be specified as the first word 
    following the name of the command, unlike the standard getopt(3)
    used for C programs. Exactly one of the options -t, -c,
    or -u is required.

    -d Debug information is printed for the benefit 
    of the application author. Exact details are not specified.

    -t The compression algorithm is activated, and the 
    decoding tree is printed to the standard output. 
    The output filename may not be specified.

    -c The input file is compressed and written to the 
    output file, if specified, or to the standard output, if not.

    -u The input file is assumed to be compressed, 
    and is uncompressed, written to the output file,
    if specified, or to the standard output, if not.

OPERANDS
            There are one or two filename operands. 
    The first is the input filename and the second is the output
    filename. If no output filename is specified, the standard
    output is written.
