NAME
    sbi.scm â€” a Silly Basic Interpreter
SYNOPSIS
    sbi.scm filename
DESCRIPTION
    The SB interpreter reads in an SBIR program from the file whose name is
    specified in the argument list, stores it in a list, and then interprets that intermediate
    representation. During interpretation, numbers are read from the
    standard input and results written to the standard output.
    Error messages are printed to the standard error. The first error, whether during
    compilation or interpretation, causes a message to be printed and the program
    to exit with an exit code of 1.
OPTIONS
    None.
OPERANDS
    The single filename argument specifies an SBIR program to be run.
EXIT STATUS
    If the program completes without error, 0 is returned. If not, 1 is returned.
